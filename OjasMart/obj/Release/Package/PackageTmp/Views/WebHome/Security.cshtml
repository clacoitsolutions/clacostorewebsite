                        Security is a critical aspect of e-commerce to protect customer information, financial
                        transactions, and the overall integrity of the online shopping experience. Here are some key
                        considerations for ensuring security in e-commerce:
                    </p>

                </div>

                <div class="job-des-dt142 policy-des-dt">
                    <h4>
                        Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Encryption
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                        Implement SSL encryption to
                        secure the transmission of sensitive data, such as credit card information, between the
                        customer's browser and the e-commerce site. SSL ensures that data is encrypted and protected
                        from interception by unauthorized parties.

                    <p>
                        Comply with PCI DSS requirements if you process credit card transactions.
                        This includes maintaining a secure network, regularly monitoring and testing systems, and
                        implementing strong access control measures to protect cardholder data.
