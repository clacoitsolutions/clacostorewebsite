                                    <b>Are there any charges for registration?</b> <br /><br />
                                    No. Registration on Clacostore.com is absolutely free.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    <b>Do I have to necessarily register to shop on Clacostore.com?</b><br /><br />
                                    You can surf and add products to the cart without registration but only registered shoppers will be able to checkout and place orders. Registered members have to be logged in at the time of checking out the cart, they will be prompted to do so if they are not logged in.<br /><br />
                                    <b>Can I have multiple registrations?</b><br /><br />

However, remember that all items placed in a single order can only be delivered to one address. If you want different products delivered to different address you need to place them as separate orders.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />

                               <b>What are the modes of payment?</b><br /><br />
                                    You can pay for your order on kifayatistore.com using the following modes of payment:<br /><br />
                                    a. Cash on delivery (COD)<br /><br />
                                    b. Credit and debit cards (VISA / Mastercard / Rupay)<br /><br />

                        If the order has to be left at the security gate, please continue to pay online via wallets, UPI, net banking, or cards as you are doing now.<br /><br />
                        If you choose COD as the payment method, you will need to pay our delivery executive in cash at the time of delivery.<br /><br />
                        To minimize contact, please give the executive the exact amount or the order total rounded up to the nearest hundred. For example, if your order value is Rs.1,235, please pay exactly this amount or Rs.1,300.<br /><br />
                        The executive will not be able to return any change. Any balance due will be credited directly to your kifayatistore.com wallet which you can utilise in your next order.<br /><br />
                        The option is currently available only for kifayatistore.com mobile app users.<br /><br />
                      <b>Are there any other charges or taxes in addition to the price shown? Is VAT added to the invoice?</b><br /><br />
                        There is no VAT. However, GST will be applicable as per Government Regulizations.<br /><br />
                    <b> Is it safe to use my credit/ debit card on kifayatistore.com?</b><br /><br />

                          Yes it is absolutely safe to use your card on kifayatistore.com. A recent directive from RBI makes it mandatory to have an additional authentication pass code verified by VISA (VBV) or MSC (Master Secure Code) which has to be entered by online shoppers while paying online using visa or master credit card. It means extra security for customers, thus making online shopping safer<br /><br />
                         <b>What is the meaning of cash on delivery?</b><br /><br />
                             Cash on delivery means that you can pay for your order at the time of order delivery at your doorstep.<br /><br />

                        <b>If I pay by credit card how do I get the amount back for items not delivered?</b> <br /><br />
                          If we are not able to delivery all the products in your order and you have already paid for them online, the balance amount will be refunded to your kifayatistore.com account as store credit and you can use it at any time against your future orders. Should you want it to be credited to your bank account please contact our customer support team and we will refund it back on to your card.<br /><br />
                         <b>Where do I enter the coupon code?</b> <br /><br />
                          Once you are done selecting your products and click on checkout you will be prompted to select delivery slot and payment method. On the payment method page there is a box where you can enter any evoucher/ coupon code that you have. The amount will automatically be deducted from your invoice value.<br /><br />
                         <b>What is kifayatistore.com Wallet?</b> <br /><br />
                          The kifayatistore.com Wallet is a pre-paid credit account that is associated with your kifayatistore.com account. This prepaid account allows you to pay a lump sum amount once to kifayatistore.com and then shop multiple times without having to pay each time.</p>
