                        EPR (Extended Producer Responsibility) compliance in claco refers to the responsibility of
                        Claco businesses to manage and mitigate the environmental impact of their products and
                        packaging throughout their lifecycle. Here are some considerations for Claco businesses to
                        ensure EPR compliance:

                        Evaluate the packaging materials used for products sold on
                        your claco platform. Opt for environmentally friendly and recyclable materials whenever
                        possible. Avoid excessive packaging and promote the use of minimal and sustainable
                        packaging practices.
