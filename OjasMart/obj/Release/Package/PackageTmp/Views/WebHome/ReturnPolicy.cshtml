                        A return policy for a Claco site outlines the rules and procedures for customers who wish to
                        return or exchange products they have purchased. It is essential to have a clear and fair return
                        policy to provide a positive customer experience and build trust. Here are some key elements to
                        consider when formulating a return policy for your Claco site:
                    </p>
                   
                </div>

                    <h4>
                        Eligibility
                    </h4>
                   
                    <p>
                        Clearly define the eligibility criteria for returns. Specify the timeframe within which
                        returns are accepted, such as 7 days from the date of delivery. State whether the product must
                        be unused, in its original packaging, and if any tags or labels must be intact.

                    </p>

                        Return Process
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Outline the step-by-step process for initiating a return. Provide clear
                        instructions on how customers can request a return, whether it's through an online form, email,
                        or a dedicated customer support channel. Consider offering a self-service return portal where
                        customers can initiate returns themselves.

                    <p>
                        Specify who is responsible for return shipping costs. Options include
                        offering free returns, providing prepaid shipping labels, or having the customer bear the return
                        shipping expenses. Clearly communicate the method of return shipping (e.g., courier service,
                        postal service) and any packaging requirements.

                        exchange the returned product for another item. Specify the timeframe within which refunds or
                        exchanges will be processed, which may depend on factors like product inspection or
                        verification.

                        Decide whether you will charge restocking fees for returned
                        products. If applicable, clearly state the percentage or flat fee that will be deducted from the
                        refund amount to cover handling and restocking costs. Ensure customers are aware of this fee
                        before initiating a return.

                        downloads may not be eligible for return due to their nature. Clearly list these exceptions to
                        avoid confusion.
